This is a kotlin app that communicates with a REST server. This was my 3rd and 4th homework project for Mobile Applications class
at UALR. This app allows a user to register a username and password to a REST server and allows them to login with the same credentials.
They can also enter 3 different chatrooms from the ChannelListActivity and can leave messages for the chatroom.
